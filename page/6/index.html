  As you know, your FeedHenry Cloud back-end is powered by the blazingly fast Node.js runtime. One of Node’s many advantages is the incredible number of modules available to it in the NPM repository. The NPM Ecosystem contains (at time of writing) 37,990 modules – a mind boggling number to choose from. This includes a wide variety of developer tools, ways of integrating into third party systems, and several hundred different ways of performing a HTTP request.

  Like all iOS developers, we’re very excited by the upcoming features in iOS7. However, as with any version upgrade, there can be breaking changes too. FeedHenry clients will need to take action on one of these changes before the official launch of iOS7. We have identified an issue in device tracking with iOS7 which could potentially impact your Analytics data. Rest assured that we have already deployed a solution. To take advantage of this solution, we are asking that our customers re-build and re-distribute new copies of their Apps to the various App Stores.

  At this point, I’ve been reviewing CVs with FeedHenry for over a year, both for roles in Ireland and the US. I’ve seen hundreds – many fresh out of college, and some who’ve spent years in industry. I’m not a recruiter – I’m an engineer looking to grow the team, and find a bunch of people who I’d like to work with. Unfortunately, a large portion of the CVs I see are pretty awful.

  We all know that smartphones, tablets, and mobile apps have transformed the way information is delivered and consumed. We also know that businesses are increasingly replacing on-premise IT infrastructure with cloud services and platforms that empower workers to use their mobile devices for work. This consumer demand for technology (CoIT, or Consumerization of IT) has presented a unique opportunity for enterprises to deploy features and services direct to end-users. Traditional enterprise software is giving way to cloud-enabled enterprise apps—partly because enterprise app development and management can be done at a fraction of the cost of traditional enterprise software deployment.

  FeedHenry’s cloud-based Mobile Application Platform includes key features for you to develop, integrate, deploy and manage mobile applications. FeedHenry’s focus is to help enterprises create mobile apps that receive and send data to multiple enterprise backend systems, enabling the enterprise to offer secure mobile data access for their customers, partners and employees. That important part of our Mobile Application Platform is called mobile Backend-as-a-Service or mBaaS where, with our open architecture and a variety of APIs, we make it possible to have rapid integration, secure connections and management of the apps and endpoints.

  Mobile Apps Dominate yet Challenge the Enterprise A well-executed mobile app strategy results in improved employee efficiency, reduction in costs and the potential to increase customer engagement and revenue generation. However, it’s not as simple as it seems. Enterprises face serious challenges, not only in keeping up with the demands to develop new and more complex apps but also in ensuring the security, scaling and management of those apps. Enterprises have turned to Mobile Application Platforms (MAP) as an end to end solution for the development, deployment, integration and management of these apps.

  If you&rsquo;ve used the FeedHenry platform to develop mobile apps, chances are you&rsquo;ve gotten to grips with some of our power user features. This post attempts to bring together all these features and tweaks that the Apps team here at FeedHenry use on a daily basis to build apps like a power user. FHC The first tool of choice is our Command Line Interface (CLI). FHC allows you to list, create, build and deploy applications in FeedHenry from the command line.

  Practicing agile on an engineering product is something which has been well documented and practiced worldwide - but introducing agile approaches to a services based team brings its own set of challenges. Here&rsquo;s some of the challenges we&rsquo;ve come across, and how we&rsquo;ve dealt with them here at FeedHenry. Iteration velocity is not a constant When building a product, eventually the team will reach a plateau where iteration velocity can be accurately measured.

  The way things were&hellip; The FeedHenry App Studio in its old form was built primarily on jQuery, jQuery-UI and numerous jQuery plugins. The main plugins used were Accordion, Tabs, Button, Dialog, jWizard, jqGrid and UI-Layout. On top of this, there was a tonne of custom CSS classes, id&rsquo;s and styles. It was (and still is) a big project with a lot of files. Despite this, it did what it was required to do i.e.

  Unit tests are an essential part of the lifecycle of any app development project, and today we&rsquo;re going to discuss the use of cloud based unit tests. Using the FeedHenry platform as a mobile Backend as a Service (mBaaS), and writing integrations with complex systems as a series of cloud based services, is an excellent strategy for developing a series of mobile applications with modular, re-usable integrations. However, these integration points become a vital interface between your backend systems and the rest of the world.
