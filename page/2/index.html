  In Madrid, in a cool location in the centre of the city, Red Hat sponsored a IoT hackathon, 3 groups used RHMAP (Red Hat Mobile Application Platform) to build their entry for the competition. Over the course of two days (19 - 20th November), 11 groups and 6 individuals battled to find out who could build the best application. We where there to get them going and help where needed. For most of them doing anything mobile or IoT was completely new, but they had some experience with Node.js, once we explained them how things globally worked and shown them how to build a simple &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; they where off.

  Version 3.5.4 of the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform has been released to all of our public hosted Grids. This is mainly a bug-fix release with one major new feature. NEW: Addition of Android API 22 (Android 5.1) to our Build Farms for our AWS Grids. Whilst our Cordova Light Apps and Forms App will default to SDK 19 for the moment, developers on AWS Grids can now specify SDK 22 for their Full Cordova and Native Android Apps in the standard ways.

  <p>
  We have now rolled out RHMAP 3.5.x to all of the relevant pre-production and production grids. There is one small breaking change which needs to be flagged. If, on deployment of your cloud code, you receive a message saying &quot;pre-deploy checks failed. Error: fh-mbaas-api version ~x.y.z is not valid. Please make sure it is &gt;=5.0.0&quot; Then you will need to do the following: Go to the Editor for the Cloud App Click on package.json Locate the line that starts with fh-mbaas-api and change it so the version is &ldquo;~5.0.0&rdquo; Click Save You can now re-deploy If you run into any issues with this change, please contact Red Hat Support via your usual channels.

  We have some really interesting and powerful new features in RHMAP v3.5.x which has just been deployed to our evaluation SaaS grids and will be deployed to the production grids next week. Lifecycle Management for Forms Builder We released our Application Lifecycle Management (ALM/LCM) functionality earlier this year and it has proven to be a big hit with customers who need strong lifecycle support in their process. The one area which didn&rsquo;t have this was our Forms Builder and we&rsquo;re pleased to now make LCM available in Forms too.

  Microsoft&rsquo;s SharePoint is commonplace in the toolset of a modern organization. It&rsquo;s a silo of information which can be quite difficult to access - but that doesn&rsquo;t always have to be the case. The Red Hat Mobile Application Platform&rsquo;s SharePoint Connector attempts to solve this problem, by making SharePoint a readily available source of data for mobile developers. This connector allows you to easily retrieve &amp; create new SharePoint Lists and List Items.

  Last Tuesday, I had the great pleasure of presenting as part of the Middleware keynote session at Red Hat Summit. I&rsquo;ve presented lots before - almost weekly to smaller audiences as part of sales, and plenty of developer evangelism presentations too.I&rsquo;ve probably presented to an audience of ~200 It&rsquo;s interesting being involved in such a high-profile demo from start to finish. There&rsquo;s a huge amount of preparation behind the scenes - our keynote efforts started a month before the presentation.

  Over the last year a lot of exciting events have hit the FeedHenry team, most notably our acquisition by Red Hat to be their new Mobile offering. This past week many team members were able to attend the annual Red Hat Summit, and it’s safe to say many spotlights were pointed our way. I’m not going to recap too much as our rebranding to become Red Hat Mobile, Samsung partnership announcement and on-stage mobile capabilities have all been well documented, but do want to cover a really exciting offering that may have slipped under some radars.

  Currently in software development the biggest challenge is integrating. A lot of what we do involves integrating with other platforms or libraries. Knowing how to integrate is important, so here I&rsquo;m going to show how to integrate the Unified Push Server (UPS) with Feedhenry, for adding push notification support. To make things even easier we created a Feedhenry Template that you can use as a starting point for your application that contains all the parts you&rsquo;ll need.
