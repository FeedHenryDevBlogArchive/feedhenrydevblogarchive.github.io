  <p>
  The Red Hat Mobile Application Platform (RHMAP) has strong authentication and authorization mechanisms baked into its Auth Policy system. Android has deep integration with Google&rsquo;s ecosystem which provides many easy mechanisms for authorizing services to act on a user&rsquo;s behalf. Out of the box RHMAP allows for connecting to a Google account using OAuth and a web view, but a better user experience is using Google&rsquo;s Android account picker. To enable this integration in RHMAP we can use an MBaaS Auth Policy.

  Two weeks ago we announced the 3.7.0 release of the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform including a Preview of our all new API Mapper. The API Mapper enables everyone from new Node.js developers to hardcore map-reducers to interact with existing back-end APIs and customise them for use in their mobile applications. This simple-looking but extremely powerful tool provides the following features: Create GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE/HEAD/OPTIONS requests Set headers Save your Requests Create a Mapping from a Request Map fields (Include/Exclude/Rename) Carry out complex data Transforms using custom Node.js code Mount mappings to specific end-points Make mappings accessible to your Cloud Code Automatically generate Node.js code and Curl requests In this post, I&rsquo;m going to walk through the functionality from the simplest request all the way to creating custom transforms.
